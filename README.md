## What is Fahrenheit?
Fahrenheit is a reverse-engineering project for the [Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD Remasters](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359870/).

It is also, in source-code form, a mod framework for the games. It allows you to freely hook game functions and distribute mods
in the form of loadable DLLs. Fahrenheit bootstraps and hosts the [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
within the games, allowing you to write mods in any compatible language.

The knowledge gathered by the project underpins many tools and mods for the game, such as the
[AI/VI TAS](https://github.com/coderwilson/FFX_TAS_Python), [Cutscene Remover](https://github.com/erickt420/FFXCutsceneRemover) mod,
[Karifean](https://github.com/Karifean)'s [FFXDataParser](https://github.com/Karifean/FFXDataParser), and more.

## Why?
Many people have made tremendous efforts to tackle this game over the years, and some have even
succeeded in creating amazing mods for these timeless games. Unfortunately, almost all such efforts were
made by lone individuals who chose not to publicize their methods and share their knowledge.
Even when they did, their knowledge may have been lost to time and is exceptionally hard to find today.

Fahrenheit attempts to put an end to this.

It aims not only to exceed all these efforts in scope, but also to stay free for others to analyze,
improve, learn from and use- now and forever.

## Cloning, building from source and testing
Fahrenheit includes submodules. To clone the entire solution, use
``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/peppy-enterprises/fahrenheit``.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure the folder you cloned to does not contain special characters. This can cause build errors.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Fahrenheit is incompatible** with [Untitled Project X](https://github.com/Kaldaien/UnX)
and ffgriever's [External File Loader for FFX/FFX-2](https://gitlab.com/ffgriever/ffx-x-2-hd-external-file-loader).
> Fahrenheit supplies its own External File Loader, and you can use [Roelin's Asset Converter](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy12/mods/288)
> for model and texture modding in conjunction with it.

Building requires Visual Studio 2026 (full IDE or Build Tools only) with the following workloads:
- .NET desktop development (latest version)
- C++ desktop development (latest version)

Once you have installed Visual Studio, enable the `vcpkg` package manager
by issuing `vcpkg integrate install` at a Developer PowerShell prompt.
Restart Visual Studio if it was open during this process.

To build at a Developer PowerShell:
```
msbuild .\Fahrenheit.slnx /t:Restore /p:Configuration=Release
msbuild .\Fahrenheit.slnx /p:Configuration=Release
msbuild .\Fahrenheit.slnx /t:Publish /p:Configuration=Release
```
If using Visual Studio, `Build Solution` performs the first two steps for you.
For a Debug build, change the `Configuration` parameter to `Debug`.

To install/test your development build:
- Create a subfolder in your game directory (where ``FFX.exe`` is) named ``fahrenheit``.
- In the directory in which you cloned Fahrenheit, navigate to the ``artifacts\deploy`` subdirectory.
- Depending on build type (Debug or Release), navigate to the ``dbg`` or ``rel`` subdirectory.
- Copy the contents of that directory (the folders ``bin``, ``mods``, etc.) to the ``fahrenheit`` subfolder in the game directory.
- Create an empty, extensionless file called `loadorder` in the `mods` directory. Add the manifest names of mods you wish to load, each on their own line.
- Open a terminal in ``fahrenheit/bin``, then issue ``.\fhstage0.exe ..\..\FFX.exe``.
- Debugging can be performed from Visual Studio. Attach to either ``fhstage0.exe`` or ``FFX.exe``, and make sure to enable [mixed-mode debugging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-debug-managed-and-native-code?view=vs-2022).

## What's next?
Time permitting, the goals (in no specific order) of the project are:
- Provide actual code-behind, helper functions, and tooling to make various modding tasks approachable.
- Provide a mod manager for end users who simply want to enjoy the game.
- Provide quality documentation for various implementation-specific details and game systems.
- In general, _polish_ every aspect of the solution.
