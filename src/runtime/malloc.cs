     * See generally issue #253.
     *
     * Effectively, the game reserves 37.5% of the default address space (0x3000_0000 bytes)
     * for its primary memory pool. It then commits things into it slowly over time.
     *
     * Reserved memory is considered used by the system regardless of how much of it is actually
     * _committed_ (i.e. in actual use). If the game serviced all memory requests from the pool,
     * there would be no problem, but it doesn't. For things like FMVs, there still has to be
     * enough additional contiguous free memory to load them.
     *
     * This worked ten or so years ago when it was made, and it works on most other platforms
     * because the high reaches of the address space should be entirely empty.
     *
     * But in the decade since, ASLR started shipping on Windows, and is the default for anything
     * built today. When such a DLL is loaded, the OS loader will place it at a random high address.
     * The amount of free memory hasn't changed, but it's now carved up into smaller blocks between
     * the randomly-placed images. There is no longer a free block large enough to fit an FMV
     * between the image at the lowest address and the game's reserved pool.
     *
     * The true solution is to reserve less. By deferring the moment memory is considered 'used'
     * to the _actual point of usage_, the truth is revealed; there was never a shortage of memory.

     * 4G of address space safely, but Square/Virtuos forgot to specify the appropriate linker flag.
     * That's why the game "requires" the "4GB patch". As per the above, it doesn't.

     * places images from circa 0x5000_0000 to 0x7FFF_FFFF like roadblocks, and the large
     * reserved pool still congests the low reaches of address space. Can we do better?
     *
     * The game eventually defers any action by its primary allocator to VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree.
     * See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc,
     * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree.
     *
     * By passing MEM_TOP_DOWN, VirtualAlloc can be induced to go top-down; that is, start allocating
     * from {7|F}FFF_FFFF downwards. This applies to the primary pool as well!
     * When the game is 4G patched, this leaves a much larger free block under 2G.
