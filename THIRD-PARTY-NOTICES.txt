Regarding the lawfulness of the decompilation and reverse engineering performed for this project

END USER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY
FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster (the “Software Product”)

Section 3. Restrictions

> You are not permitted to:

To the best of our knowledge, the reverse-engineering and decompilation work carried out for the Fahrenheit project
by EU residents is lawful based on the judgement rendered by the European Court of Justice in case C-13/20 
(https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=247056&pageIndex=0&doclang=DE&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=18380521),
which explicitly permits decompilation for the purpose of fixing defects in software applications,
and based on the extant work of other groups whose similar projects have not been ordered to desist.

Additionally, Article 6 of Directive 91/250 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009L0024) states:

> 1. The authorisation of the rightholder shall not be required where reproduction of the code and translation
> of its form within the meaning of points (a) and (b) of Article 4(1) are indispensable to obtain the information
> necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, provided
> that the following conditions are met:
>
> (a) those acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a right to use a copy of a program, or on their behalf by a person authorised to do so;
> (b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available to the persons referred to in point (a); and
> (c) those acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary in order to achieve interoperability.

To the best of our knowledge, all three conditions stated herein are fulfilled.
